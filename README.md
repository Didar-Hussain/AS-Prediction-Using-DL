In this research, we used advanced deep learning techniques to enhance the prediction of alternative splicing events in the human genome. The repository includes the code and dataset necessary for replicating our results. For more information, refer to our research paper, "DeepSplice: A Deep Learning Approach for Accurate Prediction of Alternative Splicing Events in the Human Genome".
